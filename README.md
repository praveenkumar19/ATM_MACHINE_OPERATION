# ATM_MACHINE_OPERATION
This is a simple Python program that simulates an ATM. The program first asks the user to enter a 4-digit PIN and only allows access if the correct PIN is entered. Once verified, it displays a menu with options to check the account balance, deposit money, withdraw money, or exit the program. The program also validates user input, ensuring that deposit and withdrawal amounts are positive numbers and that withdrawals do not exceed the available balance. It provides a basic, interactive way to practice Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and input handling.
